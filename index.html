        <p>HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>CSS is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different elements.</p>

        <header>What to expect</header>
        <p>This page is meant to act as a simple introduction to a few coding concepts that would be useful when learning web development.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I am learning about HTML and CSS. Together, they can be use to create responsive web pages</li>
        <li>I will also be studying the basics of UX/UI to supplement my learning.</li>

        <header>What everyone's first line of code says</header>
        <ul>
            <li>In Computer Science 101, the first program many students create is a simple one that outputs an iconic line of text: "Hello World!" </li>
            <br>
            <li>A “Hello, world!” program is traditionally used to introduce novice programmers to a programming language. “Hello, world!” is also traditionally used in a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In Javascript, you would write:</li>
            <code>console.log("Hello World!");</code>
        </ul>

        <header>How to make websites function</header>
        <p>JavaScript is a client-side scripting language as well as a server-side scripting language.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This scripting language can be written into HTML pages (also could use CSS for styling the pages), and web browsers understand the page.</li>
        <br>
        <li>This scripting language also acts like an object-oriented programming language but not a class-based object-oriented language.</li>
    </ul>

    <header>Javascript and Java</header>
    <article>
        <header>Differences between Javascript and Java</header>
        <p>They sound the same. Is Javascript the sequel to Java?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript: Easier to learn and run, runs in browser,
            not strictly object-orientated, mainly client-side.</li>
            <br>
        <li>More secure, strict OOP, steeper learning curve, 
            used literally everywhere, needs to be compiled.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>They are also used for different types of projects. Java is used to make applications on devices or browsers, while JavaScript is used primarily on HTML documents and browsers</p>

    <article>
    <header>What is a variable</header>
    <ul>
    <li>A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable. </li>
    <li>There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers). Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.</li>
    <code> let y = 13.</code>
    </ul>

    <header>Declaring Variables</header>
    <article>
    <header>To create a variable, you give it a type, a name, and a value.</header>
    <ul>
    <li>The type tells Processing what kind of value the variable will hold.</li>
    <li>The name is how you'll use the variable later in the code, like you've used width and height</li>
    <li>Information about Javascript here</li>
    </ul>
    <code> let y = 13.</code>
